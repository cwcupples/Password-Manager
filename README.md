# Password-Manager
A system where users can log in to save passwords to different services and they will be stored in encrypted files
The getch() function and associated libraries included work with Linux, but has to be removed and replaced with "#include <conio.h>" which should then make the whole thing work correctly. 
# Note
Currently trying to make the encryption method more advanced
